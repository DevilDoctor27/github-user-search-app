### 1. Added dark theme.

Adding dark theme at the beginning helping me to set my environment and then never back to this point anymore.
How to setup dark theme I found on YouTube:

### 2. Created header.

First try TypeScript is little bit confusing. But basic components seems no need complicated types or interfaces.
Also I did add FontAwesome. For NextJS it is little bit different compare to regular html. Again little bit confusing but I got it.

### 3. Searchbar.

Created button. Looks like simpliest element.
Search icon was changed because in this project I want to use font awesome but this icon is not available for free.

### 4. Font Awesome.

I figured out how to connect font awesome in my project.
Also I was trying to use specific icon, but somehow this icon didn't want to work. After some troubleshooting I figured out I am no able to use a lot of icons from library coz they are not free. So this troubleshooting could help me to realize clearly how to use all icons what I have.

### 5. Input error.

If user was not found my error text should appear and then after 4 seconds disappear.
For now this state is local.

### 6. Making User content.

Make elements for User is not difficult, everything is separated in different files.. The only thing which made me a bit struggle is content's layout for different screens. I was trying use float on image, but seems like it is impossible to use it if sibling inside grid or flex container. So I decided to use grid for whole content inside my card. Little bit magic with adjustments and everything was done. With almost no pain.
