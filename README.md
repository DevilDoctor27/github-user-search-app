# 1. Added dark theme.

Adding dark theme at the beginning helping me to set my environment and then never back to this point anymore.
How to setup dark theme I found on YouTube:

# 2. Created header.

First try TypeScript is little bit confusing. But basic components seems no need complicated types or interfaces.
Also I did add FontAwesome. For NextJS it is little bit different compare to regular html. Again little bit confusing but I got it.
